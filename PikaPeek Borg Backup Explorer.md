Of course. Here is a proposed plan for completing the PikaPeek application, focusing on its core functionality as a Borg backup
  explorer and excluding the web and database components.

  Project Plan: PikaPeek Borg Backup Explorer

  The plan is divided into four main phases:

1. Core Logic: Implement the backend functionality for interacting with the borg command-line tool.

2. GUI Development: Build the user interface using PySide6.

3. Integration: Connect the GUI to the core logic.

4. Finalization: Add final touches like error handling, testing, and packaging.

   Phase 1: Core Logic (Backend)
   
   This phase focuses on creating a Python module (Core/BorgManager.py) that will handle all interactions with Borg. This will keep
   the business logic separate from the presentation layer.
* 1.1. Borg Command Wrapper:
  
  * Create a central function to execute borg commands using Python's subprocess module.
  * Implement robust error handling to capture and report issues from borg (e.g., incorrect passwords, missing repositories).

* 1.2. Repository and Archive Functions:
  
  * List Archives: Implement a function to run borg list <repository_path> and parse the output to get a list of all archives.
  * List Archive Contents: Implement a function to run borg list <archive_path> and parse the output to get a list of files and
    directories within a specific backup.

* 1.3. Filesystem Operations:
  
  * Mount Archive: Implement a function to run borg mount <archive_path> <mount_point>. This will involve creating a temporary
    directory to serve as the mount point.
  * Unmount Archive: Implement a function to safely run borg umount <mount_point> and clean up the temporary directory.
  * Extract Files/Folders: Implement a function to run borg extract to restore selected items from an archive to a
    user-specified location.

  Phase 2: GUI Development (Frontend)
  
  This phase focuses on building the user interface components in the Gui directory.

* 2.1. Main Window Layout:
  
  * Modify Gui/GuiMain.py to create a two-pane layout using a QSplitter.
  * Left Pane (Archive Explorer): Use a QTreeWidget to display a list of repositories and their corresponding archives.
  * Right Pane (File Browser): Use a QTreeView with a QFileSystemModel to display the contents of a mounted archive.

* 2.2. Toolbar and Menus:
  
  * Add a QMenuBar and QToolBar to the main window.
  * Create QAction items for:
    * "Open Repository" (to add a new Borg repository to the list).
    * "Mount/Unmount" (to toggle the state of a selected archive).
    * "Extract" (to restore selected files).
    * "Exit".

* 2.3. Status Bar:
  
  * Add a QStatusBar to the bottom of the main window to provide feedback to the user (e.g., "Mounting archive...", "Extraction
    complete.", "Error: Repository not found.").

* 2.2. Toolbar and Menus:
  
  * Add a QMenuBar and QToolBar to the main window.
  * Create QAction items for:
    * "Open Repository" (to add a new Borg repository to the list).
      Phase 3: Integration (Connecting Backend and Frontend)
  
  This phase involves making the GUI interactive by connecting it to the core logic.

* 3.1. Event Handling:
  
  * Connect GUI signals (e.g., button clicks, menu selections) to the corresponding functions in the Core/BorgManager.py
    module.
  * When a user selects a repository, populate the Archive Explorer with its archives.
  * When a user clicks "Mount," call the mount function and, upon success, point the File Browser to the mount point.

* 3.2. Asynchronous Operations:
  
  * Use Qt's QThread to run long-running Borg operations (mount, extract, list) in the background.
  * This is critical to prevent the GUI from freezing and provide a responsive user experience.
  * Use signals and slots to communicate between the worker threads and the main GUI thread for progress updates and completion
    notifications.

  Phase 4: Finalization
  
  This phase focuses on improving the application's quality and usability.

* 4.1. Configuration:
  
  * Create a simple settings dialog where users can configure the path to the borg executable and other preferences.
  * Save and load these settings from a configuration file in the Config directory.

* 4.2. Testing:
  
  * Develop basic unit tests for the Core/BorgManager.py module to ensure the borg command outputs are parsed correctly.

* 4.3. Packaging:
  
  * Prepare a script or use a tool like PyInstaller to package the application into a standalone executable for easy
    distribution.
  
  I will proceed with this plan, starting with Phase 1. Do you approve?

Looking at your .gitignore, here are the answers to your questions:

## 1. Ignore just the data IN Books/ (keeping the directory):

```gitignore
# Keep the Books directory but ignore all its contents
Books/*
# Optional: Keep a placeholder file to preserve directory in git
!Books/.gitkeep
```

Or if you want to be more specific:
```gitignore
# Ignore specific file types in Books/
Books/*.pdf
Books/*.epub
Books/*.mobi
Books/*.txt
```

## 2. Ignore Books/ under ANY directory:

```gitignore
# This will match Books/ at any level in your directory tree
**/Books/
```

Or to ignore contents of Books/ wherever it appears:
```gitignore
**/Books/*
```

Examples of what `**/Books/` would match:
- `Books/`
- `Projects/MyLibrary/Books/`
- `Source/Data/Books/`
- `any/deep/nested/path/Books/`

## 3. "Must include" option - YES! Use `!` (negation):

```gitignore
# Ignore all Books content
**/Books/*

# BUT force include specific files/patterns
!**/Books/README.md
!**/Books/catalog.json
!**/Books/metadata/

# You can also force include by file extension
!**/Books/*.md
!**/Books/*.json
```

## Recommended update for your .gitignore:

Replace your current `Books/` line with:
```gitignore
# Books directories - ignore content but preserve structure
**/Books/*
!**/Books/.gitkeep
!**/Books/README.md
```

**Note:** The `!` patterns must come AFTER the ignore patterns they're negating. Git processes .gitignore rules in order, so you ignore first, then selectively include.
